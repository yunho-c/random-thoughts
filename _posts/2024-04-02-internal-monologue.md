Sometimes, I wonder: "Does *thinking verbally* (i.e. having an internal monologue) make one's thoughts clearer?"

And, more truthfully... "Could my *lack* of internal monologue be the reason that my head is always full of ambiguous unspecific unclear inconclusive complex complicated confusing foggy scatter-minded pre-thoughts seemingly always in complete mutual opposition?"

For a long time, I have been dissatisfied with my ability to verbally convince my thoughts to others. While I am certainly better in writing than in speaking, I have gradually acquired a verbose style of writing. 

I wanted to concretize my oft-unclear thoughts into more manageable forms so that I could digest and develop them further, and even share some of the more useful thoughts with the rest of the world — and use it as a practicing ground of learning to communicate better (& how to not give a shit about how others view my writing).

Hence, this blog started.
